Lab Assignment. Hangman

Write a computer program for a classic game Hangman where the computer picks a single word and accurately represents it as the human tries to guess all the letters in the word.

In case you are not familiar with the game Hangman, the general rules are as follows:

1) One player (the computer in this case) chooses a secret word, then writes out a number of dashes equal to the word length.

2) The other player begins guessing letters. Whenever she guesses a letter contained in the hidden word, the first player reveals each instance of that letter in the word. Otherwise, the guess is wrong.

3) The game ends either when all the letters in the word have been revealed or when the guesser has run out of guesses.
